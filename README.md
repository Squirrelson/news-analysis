# Diplomacy through news headlines and NLP
This project contains code for an analysis that scrapes news articles, analyses and aggregates their sentiment to give a quantitative measure of the state of the Australia-China diplomatic relationship.

The code is not super clean (I'm not anticipating many will want to look into it) and not fully complete. That said, it contains all the complex stuff and should be reasonably readable. Feel free to reach out if you have questions.
